## üèÜ IMC Prosperity 3

This repository contains my thought process and algorithms for IMC Prosperity 3 competition. I placed 605th globally and 3rd in Poland with a score of 342 123 seashells, submitting algorithms only in Round 2,3,4 due to lack of time and Easter holidays. 

It was my first encounter with a competition like that and algorithmic trading overall. I've learned many valuable things along the way about trading, programming and financial instruments as a whole. After competition , I am equipped with a completely new experience and ready to further my knowledge in this topic.



## üìú What is IMC Prosperity?

IMC Prosperity 3 (2025) was an algorithmic trading competition that lasted over 15 days, with over 12000 + teams participating globally. The challenge tasked teams with designing trading algorithms to maximize profits across a variety of simulated produts - replicating real-world scenarios and strategies.

The competition was presented as a game where each team represented an "island" in fictional archipelago and introduced products like Rainforest Resin, Kelp, Squid Ink, Picnic Baskets(ETF analog), Volcanic Rock and Volcanic Rock Vouchers(options) that could be traded using SeaShells, an in-game currency. It started with three products in Round 1 and ended with 15 products by the final round.

In each round, teams submitted a trading algorithm in Python, which was then evaluated against a synthethic marketplace of bot participants. Teams could optimize their algorithm basing on previous round results and data provided by competition organizers.
